I'm so sick
Of shaking
My head side to side
Like a sick, sick dog
Waiting to die
And what I see
I find
So hard to believe
And then I breathe

Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light

Poisoned with headaches
Hungry and tired
I just want happiness
I don't have to buy
Eternal life?
No thanks
I've been here once
Can't face it twice

Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light

Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
