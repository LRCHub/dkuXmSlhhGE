Imagine in a fall eclipse
The blow of the blinded moon
Evokes stardust from the cosmic sea
Rolling gathers in human form
And the shadow was trapped
Nearly close the new presences

Coronation of all knowledge
Before his god on kneel he falls
Grateful cries on the miracles' done
Backing walls with tears
It don't care where is the past
Green wings unfold
Will the child taste the sun

I am even suffocated
No one can be sleeping on his ultimate sin

Gaze into the light, before this war
Gaze into the light, before their war

Heavenly orders prepare lances and shields
Lucifer's spawn, the merciful one
Misted vision of fate, is now revealed
There's a secret place, don't you believe

I am even suffocated
No one can be dreaming of the death of the flame

Gaze into the light, before this war
Gaze into the light, before their war

Sweetest dreams belong here
In the morning disappear
On their own
Memories founded, memories fading
Can be inhibiting me
Memories spinning, surrounds me the meaning
Can be inhibiting me
Suffocating no returning
It's just like past believes
